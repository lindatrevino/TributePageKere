    <h2>Early Years and Training</h2>

     <p>After training as a carpenter, Francis Kéré studied architecture at the TU Berlin and founded Kéré Architecture in 2005. He works as he states “at the interface of utopia and pragmatism” and, as an architect, he is committed to the built environment at all levels. His best-known buildings include the Opera Village in cooperation with Christoph Schlingensief in Ouagadougou, the National Park of Mali, the Centre for Earth Architecture in Mali for the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, the Serpentine Pavilion in London and the Primary School in his home village of Gando, for which Kéré received the Aga Khan Award in 2004. New buildings such as the Benin National Assembly in Porto-Novo and the Startup Lions Campus in Turkana County, Kenya, are currently being realised. </p>

     <h2>Giving Back to the Community</h2>
<p>
     Being given the chance at such a young age to travel beyond his village and receive an education not restricted to agriculture, Kéré decided that he wanted to take his new knowledge and share it with the people who had given him such a life-changing opportunity, thus allowing others to follow in his footsteps. In Gando, villagers still live in small huts made of mud with tin or straw roofs; have literacy levels below the national average of 25%, no access to electricity and little to running water. In 2011, according to the UN Development Index, the country's lack of education, low income and life expectancy make Burkina Faso the 7th least developed country in the world.
