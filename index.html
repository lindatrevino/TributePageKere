            <h3>Early Years</h3>
            <p> Born in Buko Faso..</p>
            Kéré was born in the village of Gando. He was the first child in the village to be sent to school as his father, the village chief, wanted his eldest son to learn how to read and translate his letters. Since no school existed in Gando, Kéré had to leave his family when he was 7 years old to live with his uncle in the city.

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>After finishing his primary education, he became a carpenter and received a scholarship from the Carl Duisberg Society to do an apprenticeship in Germany as a supervisor in development aid. After completing the apprenticeship, he went on to study architecture at the Technical University of Berlin, graduating in 2004.

        During his studies he felt it was his duty to contribute to his family and to the community which had supported him, and to give the next generation the opportunity to follow in his footsteps. In 1998, with the help of his friends, Kéré set up the association Schulbausteine für Gando e.V. (now Kéré Foundation), which loosely translates as "Building Blocks for Gando", to fund the construction of a primary school for his village. His objective was to combine the knowledge he had gained in Europe, with traditional building methods from Burkina Faso. He completed his studies and built the first school in Gando as his diploma project in 2004, while also opening his own architectural office Kéré Architecture.

                Gando Primary School, 2001, Burkina Faso

                Kéré began raising money to build a primary school in his home village while studying in Germany. The Gando Primary School was Kéré's first major project and was built with the help of local villagers. It was awarded the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2004.
                
                In 2008, two years after the Gando Primary School was completed, Kéré began a major extension that created space for 120 additional students. It was constructed using local labour as well as local materials. </p>

                 <p>National Park of Mali, 2010, Mali

To mark the 50th anniversary of the independence of Mali, Kéré added a collection of buildings to the National Park in Bamako, Mali's capital, with the aim of uniting the neglected botanical and zoological gardens.

Each of the structures was clad in natural stone and designed to provide ample shaded areas for its visitors. Along with an entrance pavilion, the structures house a restaurant and sports centre. </p>
